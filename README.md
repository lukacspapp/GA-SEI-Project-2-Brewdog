# Brewdog API
A web application where users can browse and find out various information about their favourite brewdog drink based on [Brewdog's Api](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2)

### Welcome Page

### Deployed version

https://github.com/lukacspapp/Project-2-Brewdog-Api

## Code Installation

- Clone or download the repo
- Navigate to project-2-start folder
- Install yarn in Terminal by typing: <code>yarn</code>
- Start server with <code>yarn start</code>

## Planning


### Testing the API on Insomnia

We were pretty set on the Brewdog's Api as it was free to use and the infromation was quiet nested so it gave us a good opportunity to practice how to get to nested data.


<img src='https://i.imgur.com/GKzjGIK.png'>

The API returns data from 25 different beers including the name, alchol content, description, image, ingridients, brewing tips, food pairing information

We displayed 9 different types of data from the nested API that we displayed on the app



## Development

We decided to have a simple three-page application: Welcome Page(/), Index Page(/beers) and a View of a Single Page (beers/id).


### Welcome Page:

  The Welcome page is a really simple one as it can be seen here <img src='https://i.imgur.com/vGySNjK.png'>
  It has two buttons, the 'Discover Brewdog!' that will take you to the index page(/beers), and the 'Generate a random Brewdog! 
  that will take you to the view of a single beer page (beers/random).
  It also has a navbar, that has two buttons one is our logo that we got from [Giphy](https://giphy.com/gifs/BrewDogOfficial-brewdog-punk-ipa-iE3lwBCEBdzA6HQJRo)
  which displayed all the time on all pages and it always redirects the user back to the home page.
  
  The other button is the üç∫Brewdog APIüç∫  which is conditionally rendered that will take you to the beer index page(/beers). While you are on the index page(/beers) the button moves to the right hand side of the navbar and once you have selected an individual beer it will move back to the right hand side.


### Index Page:
  
  <img src='https://i.imgur.com/vbF9gLB.png'>
  
  The index page which is in the BeerDisply component and returns the image, name , tagline and the first brewed time of the 25 beers. The page also has a filter that lets the user filter through the beers according to their ABV content. The filter is on the right handside of the navbar that is conditionally rendered. It is only visible when the user is on the Index page.

On load the index page triggers the <code>getData</code> function that makes the request to the API with axios and sets the data to a <code>useState</code>
  ```
  const [beers, setBeers] = useState([])
  const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false)
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const getData = async () => {
      try {
        const { data } = await axios.get('https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers')
        setBeers(data)
      } catch (err) {
        setHasError(true)
      }
    }
    getData()
  }, [])
  
  ```
  As the function is in a <code>useEffect</code> the <code>getData</code> function gets called whenver there is change in the array of beers.
  
  The is a filter on this page which it executed by the <code>newBeers</code> function on a click event.
  
  <img src='https://i.imgur.com/QMiCsgm.png'>
  
  ```
  const handleClick = (event) => {
    const newBeers = beers.filter((beer) => {
      return beer.abv >= parseFloat(event.target.value) && beer.abv <= (parseFloat(event.target.value) + 2)
    })
    setFilteredBeers(newBeers)
  }
  ```
  
  There is also Error handling which is executed with a ternary operator.
  
  ```
  {filteredBeers.length > 0 ?
      <div className='container' id='container'>
        <div className='tile is-ancestor is-flex-wrap-wrap is-flex-direction-row'>
          {filteredBeers.map(beer => {
            return (
              <div key={beer.id} className="tile is-3 is-parent">
                <Link className="tile is-child" id='background' to={`/beers/${beer.id}`}>

              )
            })}
          </div>
        </div></>}
    <h2 className="title has-text-centered">
      {hasError ? 'Oh something went wrong, There are no beers to display üòû' : ' Beers are Loading...'}
      
```      
 
 


### View of a Single Beer Page:

The view of a single beer page is in the BeerInfo component and returns the image, name, description, ABV percentage, brewery tips, food pairing recommendations and the ingridients of the selected beer.
  
There is a randomly generated beer option is available from the home page as well which is handled in this component. It is a great feature of this API that you can make a request to <code>https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers/random</code> and it will give us a all the data from a randomly generated beer. We added some error handling as some of the beers does not have an image. We have set the image_url to a state and if that array return null an error image appear next to the beer information.

```
  <div className='column is-half'>{url !== null ? <img src={beers.image_url}></img> : <img src={error}></img> }</div>
```

There is also some extra error handling in case the any of the api takes a bit more time to load or do not return anything back to the user

```
{beers ? <div>
            <div className='title has-text-centered'> <h1>{beers.name}</h1></div><hr /><div className='columns'>
              <div className='column is-half'>{url !== null ? <img src={beers.image_url}></img> : <img src={error}></img> }</div>

          }
          
 ```         



### Styling

For styling we used <img src='https://bulma.io/images/bulma-logo.png' width="112" height="28"

## Wins

Styling :sparkles: . Very pleased with how fun this app is, we learnt so much about animations, timers and using conditional rendering.

Teamwork :raised_hands: . This was the first time I pair-coded for almost 2 days and it was a wonderful experience. Rob and I were always in sync and found that bouncing personal ideas off each other always resulted in something better.

## Challenges

CORS :no_entry_sign: . While we were able to solve this easily after deployment, the why of it took me a while to fully understand. Our tutor was very helpful in explaining CORS in details.

### Bugs

Audio Volume: We set the audio volume as 0.6 as a starting point so its not too loud for the user. Due to this, it is not possible to change the volume of the track. We struggled to figure out if React Audio Player‚Äôs volume can be changed through state ‚Äî so this will be a bug we need to solve in future.


## Key Learnings

* React.js: As this was my first React App, I learned a lot about conditional rendering, how state works and how to pass props using URLs.

* CSS Animations: Not only was this fun, but I feel very confident working with transitions and animations after this project.


## Future Improvements

* Make it Responsive
* Audio Fade in and out
```
